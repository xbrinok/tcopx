### Debugging
You are welcome in helping to minimize the impact of bugs. There are classes, binded to global context. Look through the code for certain one and just get it by its name in developer tools.
Source maps are included in production build for your convenience.

#### Additional query parameters
* **test=1**: to use test DCs
* **debug=1**: to enable additional logging
* **noSharedWorker=1**: to disable Shared Worker, can be useful for debugging
* **http=1**: to force the use of HTTPS transport when connecting to Telegram servers

Should be applied like that: http://localhost:8080/?test=1
